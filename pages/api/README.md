Creating a NextJS API allows using the Moralis SDK safely inside:

> "API routes provide a solution to build your [API with NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
> Any file inside the `pages/api` folder is mapped to `/api/*` and will be
> treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. They are **server-side-only**
> bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size."
